# 🍎 Python Lists — Chapter 1

Welcome to the **Lists** section of my DSA with Python learning journey!  
This folder contains my practice programs and a mini project based on **Python Lists** — one of the most fundamental and versatile data structures in Python.

## 🧠 What I Learned

- Creating and accessing list elements  
- Positive and negative indexing  
- List slicing (start, end, step)  
- Repetition with `*` operator  
- Common list methods:
  - `append()`
  - `extend()`
  - `insert()`
  - `pop()`
  - `reverse()`
- Using `enumerate()` for index-value iteration  
- Performing real-world operations with lists
